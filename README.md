# BlackBerry Native Development plugin for Visual Studio

This project is a full-featured package for Visual Studio enabling BlackBerry native (C/C++/Cascades) development. It configures your favorite IDE in few clicks and stays always up-to-date as installed via [VS Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=blackberry%20qnx&f%5B0%5D.Value=blackberry%20qnx&f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&ac=4).

It was once a project owned by BlackBerry itself. However since it was so impressively improved, BlackBerry made an official release [Gold 3.0](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2015/03/more-gold-blackberry-native-plug-in-for-microsoft-visual-studio/) purely basing on my contribution.

The easiest and most natural way of starting development for new platform. Templates for new BlackBerry C/C++ projects are already there and waiting for the job to start.


### Automatic MSBuild update
![Auto MSBuild update](/media/info/feature-auto-msbuild.png)

Validates build environment and might suggest updating MSBuild on fresh install, or when plugin gets updated in the future. No manual copying files around!

### GDB Integration
![GDB](/media/info/feature-gdb.png)

Set a breakpoint, hit F5 and observe, how the application is build, uploaded to the device and stops at requested location. It contains full-blown GDB integration with:
 * breaking at location
 * stepping through the code
 * local variables preview
 * and much more!

### IntelliSense Support
![IntelliSense](/media/info/feature-intellisense.png)

The original headers from active BlackBerry NDK are processed and IntelliSense can serve descriptions to classes and methods, while coding. It works great for C/C++ files, QML is not supported yet.

### QML colorizing Support
![QML Colorizer](/media/info/feature-qml.png)

Not leaving QML too far. There is a basic QML colorizer build-in, to mark words as known types, numbers, strings or comments, while coding.

### Device Browsing Support
![Target Navigator](/media/info/feature-target-navigator.png)

It's possible to navigate over file system remotely, copying files to/from the device and even kill processes, if developing headless applications or cards.

### Settings
![Project Options](/media/info/feature-project-settings.png)

![Global Options](/media/info/feature-options.png)

And almost all aspect of the project can be changed or tuned. Also if you dislike Momentics too, you can directly inside Visual Studio:
 * register as BlackBerry developer
 * download latest BlackBerry NDK
 * generate debug tokens and upload them onto devices
 * and more!
